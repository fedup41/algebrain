How do I use this?  For starters, remember your algebra days.  These are examples of how an equation looks for algebrain.

`sin(20) + sin(30)`

`match('ABC123XYZ', 'abc', true)`

`sqrt(9)`

`3 / 4 + 1 / 4`  which is different than `3 / (4 + 1) / 4`

And of course functions can be nested: `sqrt(sin(3 / 4 + 1 / 4))` and `not(empty(match('ABC123XYZ', 'abc', true)))`.

Then multiple equations can be "chained" together.

`a:=3; b:=4; c := sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`
